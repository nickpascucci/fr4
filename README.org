#+TITLE: FR4

FR4 is a printed circuit board layout and design tool. The goal is to do for PCB
design what OpenSCAD did for STLs. Boards are described using a programming
language which generates a model of the design. This model can then be rendered
for display, serialized to a Gerber file set for manufacture, or simulated for
design verification.

* Building FR4

All you should need to build FR4 is an up-to-date Rust installation.
